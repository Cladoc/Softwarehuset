Set Project Leader() & checkProjectLeader returns reference. 
Try to find a pattern that calls these methods in the list without duplicating for loop code and returning reference

Possible patterns to use (add if you find something nice):
Here is a list: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/index.htm
1) Singleton pattern for project planner (very simple)
2) Filter pattern when searching for project
3) Null Object Pattern (in case needed)
4) Strategy pattern for distinguishing between Developer and Project Leader?
5) Observer pattern for interface
6) Decorator pattern for separating checks on Developer ID check and actions

We've unknowingly used the facade pattern for LibraryApp and ProjectPlanner. Look it up
